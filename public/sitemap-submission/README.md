# Sitemap Submission Guide

This guide details how to locate, validate, and submit the XML sitemap for **UK Commercial Flooring** to major search engines. Proper submission ensures faster indexing of new content, including location pages, blog posts, and case studies.

## 1. Sitemap Location & Structure

### Live Sitemap URL
The XML sitemap is dynamically generated by the React application. You can access it directly in your browser:

- **Primary URL:** `https://www.ukcommercialflooring.co.uk/sitemap.xml`
- **Alternative:** `https://www.ukcommercialflooring.co.uk/sitemap`

*Note: Since this is a Single Page Application (SPA), the sitemap is rendered client-side for immediate viewing, or generated as a static file during the build process if the `npm run generate-sitemap` script is used.*

### Sitemap Content Structure
The sitemap automatically includes:
- **Core Service Pages:** (Epoxy, Latex, Shot Blasting, Liquid Screed)
- **Location Pages:** Dynamic pages for all major UK cities (e.g., `/locations/manchester`, `/locations/leeds`)
- **Sub-Location Pages:** Specific pages for Birmingham districts.
- **Blog Posts:** All published articles from the blog hub.
- **Case Studies:** Individual project portfolios.

### Generation Method
The sitemap logic resides in `src/utils/generateSitemap.js`. It pulls data from:
- `src/data/ukCities552.js`
- `src/data/blogPosts.js`
- `src/data/caseStudies.js`
